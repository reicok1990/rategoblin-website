                <!-- ==================== 3. HOW WE USE AI ==================== -->
                <h2>3. How We Use AI</h2>
                <p>
                    This section explains how artificial intelligence is used within Rates Goblin AI, what data is shared
                    with our AI sub-processor, and your rights in relation to AI processing.
                </p>

                <h3>3.1 AI Processing Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Rates Goblin AI uses <strong>OpenAI GPT-4o</strong> to process uploaded construction quotes and cost plans.
                    AI is used for extracting line items, classifying items against NRM categories, benchmarking rates, and
                    answering your natural-language questions about your project data.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 Data Sent to OpenAI</h3>
                <p>The following data is sent to OpenAI for processing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extracted text from your uploaded documents (PDF and Excel)</li>
                    <li>Line item descriptions, rates, and quantities</li>
                    <li>Your natural language questions and prompts</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.3 Data NOT Sent to OpenAI</h3>
                <p>The following data is <strong>never</strong> sent to OpenAI:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your password</li>
                    <li>Your email address</li>
                    <li>Personal identity information</li>
                    <li>Device fingerprints</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.4 International Transfer</h3>
                <p>
                    OpenAI is a US-based sub-processor. Data transferred to OpenAI is protected under
                    appropriate safeguards, specifically the <strong>UK Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses
                    (SCCs)</strong>. All data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS.
                </p>

                <h3>3.5 OpenAI Data Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    Data sent via the OpenAI API is <strong>not used for model training</strong>, in accordance with
                    OpenAI's API data usage policy. Your commercial data remains confidential and is not used to improve
                    OpenAI's models.
                </p>

                <h3>3.6 Consent</h3>
                <p>
                    You must give <strong>explicit consent</strong> before any AI processing occurs. No data will be sent
                    to OpenAI until you have actively opted in. You can withdraw your consent at any time by navigating to
                    <strong>Settings &gt; AI</strong> within the application.
                </p>

                <h3>3.7 AI Transparency</h3>
                <p>
                    All AI-generated outputs include confidence scores and are clearly labelled with AI disclosure badges,
                    so you always know when information has been generated or processed by AI.
                </p>

                <h3>3.8 Support Chat AI</h3>
                <p>
                    The in-app Support Chat uses <strong>GPT-4o Mini</strong> and processes only your chat messages.
                    Your uploaded documents are <strong>not</strong> shared with the Support Chat AI model.
                </p>

                <!-- ==================== 3A. COMMUNITY RATE BENCHMARKING DATABASE ==================== -->
                <h2>3A. Community Rate Benchmarking Database</h2>
                <p>
                    Rates Goblin AI offers an optional <strong>Community Rate Benchmarking Database</strong>. If you
                    choose to opt in, anonymised and aggregated rate data from your uploaded quotes may be contributed
                    to a shared industry benchmarking pool. This section explains exactly what this means and how
                    your data is used.
                </p>

                <h3>3A.1 What Is the Community Rate Benchmarking Database?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Community Rate Benchmarking Database is a pool of <strong>anonymised construction rate data</strong>
                    contributed voluntarily by Rates Goblin AI users. This data is used to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build and improve industry-wide construction rate benchmarks</li>
                    <li>Provide more accurate regional rate comparisons for all users</li>
                    <li>Identify market trends and pricing patterns across the UK construction sector</li>
                    <li>Enhance the accuracy of Rates Goblin AI's benchmarking features over time</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3A.2 What Data Is Contributed?</h3>
                <p>If you opt in, the following data <strong>may</strong> be added to the benchmarking pool:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Line item descriptions (e.g. "supply and fix plasterboard to ceilings")</li>
                    <li>Unit rates, quantities, and units of measurement</li>
                    <li>NRM element classifications</li>
                    <li>General project region (e.g. "South East England") &mdash; not the specific project address</li>
                    <li>Project type (e.g. "new build residential", "office refurbishment")</li>
                    <li>Approximate project value band (e.g. "&pound;500k&ndash;&pound;1m")</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3A.3 What Data Is NOT Contributed?</h3>
                <p>The following data is <strong>never</strong> included in the benchmarking pool:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your name, email address, or any personal information</li>
                    <li>Your company name or your client's name</li>
                    <li>Contractor names or subcontractor names</li>
                    <li>Specific project names or addresses</li>
                    <li>Any data that could identify you, your client, or any third party</li>
                    <li>Full document content &mdash; only extracted, anonymised rate data</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3A.4 Anonymisation Process</h3>
                <p>
                    Before any rate data enters the benchmarking pool, it undergoes an <strong>anonymisation process</strong>
                    that strips all identifying information. The anonymised data cannot be traced back to any individual user,
                    company, project, or contractor. Once anonymised, the data is no longer personal data under UK GDPR.
                </p>

                <h3>3A.5 Consent &mdash; Separate and Explicit</h3>
                <p>
                    Participation in the Community Rate Benchmarking Database is <strong>entirely voluntary</strong> and requires
                    <strong>separate, explicit consent</strong>. This consent is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Separate from AI consent:</strong> You can use AI features without contributing to the benchmarking database, and vice versa.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clearly presented:</strong> You will be asked to opt in via a dedicated consent dialog that explains exactly what data will be contributed and how it will be used.</li>
                    <li><strong>Revocable at any time:</strong> You can withdraw your consent at any time by navigating to <strong>Settings &gt; Data &amp; Privacy &gt; Benchmarking</strong>. Withdrawing consent means no further data will be contributed from your account going forward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not a condition of service:</strong> You are not required to opt in to use Rates Goblin AI. Opting out has no effect on your access to features or service quality.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> Because data is anonymised before it enters the benchmarking pool, we cannot
                    retrospectively remove data that has already been contributed and anonymised. However, no future data will
                    be contributed once you withdraw consent.
                </p>

                <h3>3A.6 Lawful Basis</h3>
                <p>
                    The lawful basis for processing rate data for the Community Rate Benchmarking Database is
                    <strong>consent</strong> (Article 6(1)(a) UK GDPR). You must actively opt in before any data
                    is contributed.
                </p>

                <h3>3A.7 How the Benchmarking Data Benefits You</h3>
                <p>
                    Users who contribute to the benchmarking pool help build a stronger, more accurate rate database
                    for the entire UK construction industry. In return, all Rates Goblin AI users (including those who
                    do not contribute) benefit from improved benchmarking accuracy. We may, in the future, offer
                    enhanced benchmarking features exclusively to contributing users.
