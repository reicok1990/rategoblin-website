        <span class="overline">Core Feature</span>
        <h2>AI Quote Extraction</h2>
        <p>Upload subcontractor quotes as PDF or Excel and let AI extract every line item in seconds, not hours.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="features-grid">
        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon blue">&#128196;</div>
          <h3>PDF &amp; Excel Upload</h3>
          <p>Drag and drop PDF or Excel files directly into the platform. Rates Goblin parses multi-page documents and complex spreadsheet layouts automatically, handling merged cells, nested tables, and inconsistent formatting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon green">&#129302;</div>
          <h3>Intelligent Line Item Extraction</h3>
          <p>AI identifies and extracts every line item with full detail: description, quantity, unit of measurement, unit rate, and total amount. Achieves 80%+ accuracy on first pass, even on poorly formatted or handwritten-style quotes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon purple">&#128065;</div>
          <h3>Scanned PDF Support via Vision AI</h3>
          <p>Scanned or image-based PDFs are processed through Vision AI (OCR), converting printed and handwritten text into structured data. No need to request digital copies from subcontractors.</p>
        </div>

          <p>Review and correct any AI-extracted value directly in the interface. Every edit is logged with a full audit trail — who changed what, when, and from which original value — ensuring complete traceability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon blue">&#9989;</div>
          <h3>QS Sign-Off Workflow</h3>
          <p>Extracted quotes remain in draft until a qualified quantity surveyor reviews and formally signs off. This approval workflow ensures no unverified data enters your rate library or cost comparisons.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon green">&#128202;</div>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon blue">&#128200;</div>
          <h3>Historical Rate Comparison</h3>
          <p>Every extracted rate is automatically compared against your organisation's historical rate library. See at a glance whether a subcontractor's price is competitive, average, or above market based on your own data.</p>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon amber">&#128308;</div>
          <h3>Benchmark Deviation Indicators</h3>

        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon green">&#127919;</div>
          <h3>Rate Accuracy Over Time</h3>

          <h3>RICS NRM Standards (Level 1/2/3)</h3>
          <p>AI classifies every extracted item against the RICS New Rules of Measurement hierarchy — from high-level NRM Level 1 elements down to granular Level 2 and Level 3 sub-elements, matching the structure professional QS teams use daily.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon green">&#127919;</div>
          <h3>Confidence Scoring &amp; Auto-Approve</h3>
          <p>Each NRM classification receives a confidence score. Classifications scoring 85% or above are auto-approved, while lower-confidence items are queued for manual QS review, balancing speed with accuracy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon blue">&#128203;</div>

        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon amber">&#128196;</div>

        </div>

        <div class="feature-card">
          <div class="feature-icon blue">&#9989;</div>
          <h3>Sign-Off Workflow</h3>
          <p>Cost plans follow the same rigorous sign-off workflow as quotes. A qualified QS must review and approve before a cost plan becomes the active benchmark, ensuring data integrity across your projects.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="feature-icon green">&#128204;</div>
          <h3>Section Headers &amp; Structure</h3>
