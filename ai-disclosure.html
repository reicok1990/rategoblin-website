                <!-- ==================== 1. OUR COMMITMENT TO AI TRANSPARENCY ==================== -->
                <h2>1. Our Commitment to AI Transparency</h2>
                <p>
                    Rates Goblin AI is built with transparency at its core. We believe you should always know when AI
                    is processing your data, what it does with that data, and what its limitations are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This page explains exactly how artificial intelligence works within our platform. It is written in
                    plain language so that anyone &mdash; not just technical specialists &mdash; can understand what is
                    happening behind the scenes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our approach to AI transparency has been informed by the
                    <strong>RICS Global Standard on Responsible Use of AI in Surveying</strong> and the
                    <strong>CIOB Code of Practice for Project Management</strong> principles. These standards emphasise
                    accountability, human oversight, and clear disclosure whenever AI is used in professional practice.
                </p>

                <!-- ==================== 2. AI MODELS WE USE ==================== -->
                <h2>2. AI Models We Use</h2>
                <p>
                    The table below lists every AI model used in Rates Goblin AI, what it does, and who provides it.
                    We will update this table whenever we add, remove, or change an AI model.

                <!-- ==================== 3. WHAT DATA IS SENT TO AI ==================== -->
                <h2>3. What Data Is Sent to AI</h2>
                <p>
                    We want you to know exactly what information leaves our servers and is sent to an AI provider
                    for processing. Here is a clear breakdown.
                </p>

                <h3>3.1 Data That IS Sent</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extracted text from your uploaded quotes and cost plans</li>
                    <li>Line item descriptions, quantities, rates, and amounts</li>
                    <li>Your natural language questions (when using the AI Query Assistant)</li>
                    <li>Cost plan section descriptions (when using column mapping or classification features)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.2 Data That Is NOT Sent</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your email address</li>
                    <li>Your password</li>
                    <li>Personal identity information</li>
                    <li>Device fingerprints</li>
                    <li>Your IP address</li>
                    <li>Session data or authentication tokens</li>
                    <li>Other users' data &mdash; your data is isolated and never mixed with another user's data</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.3 How Data Is Transmitted</h3>
                <p>
                    All data is sent via <strong>encrypted HTTPS connections</strong>. Data is processed by
                    OpenAI's API and, in accordance with OpenAI's API data usage policy (as of 2024),
                    <strong>is not used for model training</strong>. See Section 9 for more detail on OpenAI's
                    data processing practices.
                </p>

                <!-- ==================== 4. CONSENT & CONTROL ==================== -->
                <h2>4. Consent &amp; Control</h2>
                <p>
                    You are always in control of whether AI processes your data. Here is how consent works in
                    Rates Goblin AI:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Explicit consent required:</strong> You must give explicit consent before any AI
                        feature processes your data. No data is sent to any AI provider until you actively opt in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Clear consent dialog:</strong> Consent is requested via a clear modal dialog that
                        explains what data will be processed, which AI model will be used, and what the output will be.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Withdraw at any time:</strong> You can withdraw your AI consent at any time by
                        navigating to <strong>Settings &gt; AI</strong>. Withdrawing consent immediately stops all
                        AI processing &mdash; no further data will be sent to any AI provider.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use Rates Goblin AI without AI:</strong> You can use Rates Goblin AI without AI
                        features. Manual data entry, benchmarking, and export all work without AI consent.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Auditable consent records:</strong> AI consent is tracked with timestamps and
                        version numbers, so there is a clear record of when consent was given or withdrawn. This
                        supports audit compliance.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- ==================== 5. CONFIDENCE SCORING & HUMAN OVERSIGHT ==================== -->
                <h2>5. Confidence Scoring &amp; Human Oversight</h2>
                <p>
                    AI is not infallible. That is why every AI output in Rates Goblin AI includes a confidence score
                    and is subject to human review before it is finalised.
                </p>

                <h3>5.1 Confidence Scores</h3>
                <p>
                    Every AI-generated output includes a <strong>confidence score</strong> expressed as a percentage
                    from 0% to 100%. This score indicates how confident the AI model is in its output.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong style="color: #22c55e;">Green (85%+)</strong> &mdash; High confidence. The AI is
                        confident in its output, but you should still review it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong style="color: #f59e0b;">Amber (70&ndash;84%)</strong> &mdash; Review recommended.
                        The AI's output may need correction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong style="color: #ef4444;">Red (below 70%)</strong> &mdash; Manual check needed. The
                        AI's output should be treated as a starting point only and verified by a qualified professional.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5.2 NRM Classification Threshold</h3>
                <p>
                    NRM classifications that fall below <strong>85% confidence</strong> are automatically flagged as
                    <strong>"pending suggestion"</strong> and require manual approval by a qualified quantity surveyor
                    before they are applied.
                </p>

                <h3>5.3 AI Disclosure Badges</h3>
                <p>
                    All AI-generated content is visually marked with purple <strong>"AI"</strong> disclosure badges
                    throughout the interface. This ensures you always know which data was machine-generated and which
                    was entered manually.
                </p>

                <h3>5.4 QS Sign-Off Workflow</h3>
                <p>
                    The QS sign-off workflow ensures that a <strong>named professional reviews and accepts all
                    AI outputs</strong> before they are finalised. AI outputs remain in a draft state until a
                    qualified professional has reviewed and approved them.
                </p>

                <!-- ==================== 6. AI ACCURACY & LIMITATIONS ==================== -->
                <h2>6. AI Accuracy &amp; Limitations</h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be honest about what AI can and cannot do. Here are the known limitations of AI
                    within Rates Goblin AI:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Extraction accuracy:</strong> Extraction accuracy is typically <strong>80%+</strong>
                        on well-structured documents. This means that approximately 1 in 5 items may need manual
                        correction, even in ideal conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Document quality matters:</strong> Accuracy depends heavily on document quality.
                        Poorly scanned PDFs, handwritten notes, unusual formatting, or non-standard layouts may
                        significantly reduce accuracy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>NRM misclassification:</strong> The AI may misclassify NRM elements, especially for
                        unusual, specialist, or highly specific items that do not clearly map to standard NRM categories.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rate grouping errors:</strong> Rate grouping may incorrectly merge items that appear
                        similar but are distinct, or split items that should be grouped together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>AI Query Assistant limitations:</strong> The AI Query Assistant derives all figures
                        from your uploaded data and published benchmarks &mdash; it does not fabricate numbers. However,
                        it may misinterpret the context of your question or return figures from the wrong part of your
                        data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Professional review is essential:</strong> AI outputs should <strong>always</strong> be
                        reviewed by a qualified professional before any reliance is placed upon them. AI is a tool to
                        assist professionals, not a replacement for professional judgement.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- ==================== 6A. COMMUNITY RATE BENCHMARKING DATABASE ==================== -->
                <h2>6A. Community Rate Benchmarking Database</h2>
                <p>
                    Rates Goblin AI uses contributed rate data to build and improve an industry-wide
                    <strong>Community Rate Benchmarking Database</strong>. This section explains how AI
                    interacts with the benchmarking pool.
                </p>

                <h3>6A.1 How AI Uses Benchmarking Data</h3>
                <p>
                    When you use Rates Goblin AI's benchmarking features (e.g. comparing your rates against
                    industry averages), the AI may reference aggregated data from the Community Rate
                    Benchmarking Database to provide more accurate and up-to-date comparisons. This data is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Anonymised:</strong> No personal data, company names, or project-specific details are present in the benchmarking pool.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aggregated:</strong> Individual rates are combined into statistical ranges (e.g. low/median/high) &mdash; the AI never exposes another user's specific rates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voluntarily contributed:</strong> Only users who have given separate, explicit benchmarking consent contribute data to the pool.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6A.2 AI Does Not Train on Your Data</h3>
                <p>
                    The Community Rate Benchmarking Database is <strong>not used to train AI models</strong>.
                    Benchmarking data is used as a <strong>reference dataset</strong> that the AI queries to
                    provide rate comparisons and insights. The AI models themselves (GPT-4o) remain unchanged
                    &mdash; only the reference data they compare against is enriched by user contributions.
                </p>

                <h3>6A.3 Separate Consent</h3>
                <p>
                    Contributing to the benchmarking database requires <strong>separate, explicit consent</strong>
                    that is independent from your AI processing consent. You can use AI features without contributing
                    to benchmarking, and you can contribute to benchmarking without using AI features. Full details
