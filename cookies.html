                <h2>1. What Are Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) when
                    you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, to remember your
                    preferences, and to provide information to the website operator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This policy also covers similar technologies such as <strong>session storage</strong> and
                    <strong>local storage</strong>, which allow websites to store data in your browser for similar
                    purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Cookie Policy explains how Rates Goblin uses cookies and similar technologies when you
                    visit our website or use our service.
                </p>

                <!-- ==================== 2. HOW WE USE COOKIES ==================== -->
                <h2>2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    Rates Goblin uses only <strong>strictly necessary cookies</strong>. These cookies are essential
                    for the operation of our service and cannot be switched off. They are usually set in response to
                    actions you take, such as logging in or setting your cookie consent preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do <strong>not</strong> use:

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Because we only use strictly necessary cookies, we do not require your consent to set them under
                    UK data protection law. However, we still inform you of their use through this policy and our
                    cookie consent banner.

                <!-- ==================== 4. DEVICE FINGERPRINTING ==================== -->
                <h2>4. Device Fingerprinting</h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to cookies, Rates Goblin uses <strong>browser fingerprinting technology</strong>
                    to identify devices for security purposes. This is an important part of how we protect your
                    account and enforce the terms of our service.
                </p>

                <h3>4.1 Why We Use Device Fingerprinting</h3>
                <p>
                    Device fingerprinting is used to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevent credential sharing between unauthorised users</li>
                    <li>Enforce device limits on your account (2&ndash;3 registered devices per user, depending on your plan)</li>
                    <li>Detect and prevent unauthorised access to your account</li>
                    <li>Provide you with visibility over which devices are connected to your account</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4.2 What Data Is Collected</h3>
                <p>
                    The device fingerprint is generated from the following browser and device characteristics:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browser type and version</li>
                    <li>Operating system</li>
                    <li>Screen resolution</li>
                    <li>Timezone</li>
                    <li>Canvas rendering characteristics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This data is <strong>hashed into an anonymous identifier</strong>. The hash is a one-way function,
                    meaning we cannot reverse it to reconstruct the original data or identify you personally from the
                    fingerprint alone.
                </p>

                <h3>4.3 Lawful Basis</h3>
                <p>
                    Device fingerprinting is processed under the lawful basis of <strong>legitimate interest</strong>
                    (platform security and prevention of credential sharing). We have conducted a Legitimate Interest
                    Assessment and concluded that this processing is necessary and proportionate to protect both your
                    account and the integrity of the service.
                </p>

                <h3>4.4 How It Works</h3>
                <p>
                    Fingerprint data is stored in your browser's <strong>session storage</strong> and is sent to our
                    server during the authentication process. It is used to match your current device against your list
                    of registered devices.
                </p>

                <h3>4.5 Managing Your Devices</h3>
                <p>
                    You can view and manage your registered devices at any time by navigating to
                    <strong>Settings &gt; Security</strong> within the Rates Goblin application. From there, you can
                    deregister devices you no longer use.
                </p>

                <!-- ==================== 5. THIRD-PARTY COOKIES ==================== -->
                <h2>5. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    Rates Goblin does <strong>not</strong> set any third-party cookies on your device.
