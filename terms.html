                <!-- 6A. Community Rate Benchmarking Database -->
                <h2>6A. Community Rate Benchmarking Database</h2>
                <p>Rates Goblin maintains a <strong>Community Rate Benchmarking Database</strong> &mdash; a shared pool of anonymised construction rate data contributed voluntarily by users to improve industry-wide rate intelligence.</p>

                <h3>6A.1 Opt-In Only</h3>
                <p>Participation is <strong>entirely voluntary</strong>. You will only contribute rate data to the benchmarking database if you have given <strong>separate, explicit consent</strong> via the dedicated benchmarking opt-in within the application. This consent is independent of your AI processing consent.</p>

                <h3>6A.2 What You Are Contributing</h3>
                <p>If you opt in, <strong>anonymised rate data</strong> extracted from your uploaded quotes may be added to the benchmarking pool. This includes line item descriptions, unit rates, quantities, NRM classifications, general project region, and project type. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy (Section 3A)</a> for the full list of what is and is not contributed.</p>

                <h3>6A.3 Anonymisation</h3>
                <p>All contributed data is anonymised before it enters the benchmarking pool. No personal data, company names, contractor names, client names, or specific project details are included. Once anonymised, the data cannot be traced back to you.</p>

                <h3>6A.4 Licence to Anonymised Data</h3>
                <p>By opting in to the Community Rate Benchmarking Database, you grant Rates Goblin a <strong>perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence</strong> to use, store, aggregate, analyse, and distribute the <strong>anonymised rate data</strong> contributed from your account for the purposes of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Building and maintaining construction rate benchmarks</li>
                    <li>Providing benchmarking features to Rates Goblin users</li>
                    <li>Publishing aggregated industry rate reports and insights</li>
                    <li>Improving the accuracy of Rates Goblin's analysis and AI features</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>For clarity:</strong> This licence applies only to the <strong>anonymised, aggregated data</strong> &mdash; not to your original uploaded documents, your account data, or any identifiable information. You retain full ownership of your original data at all times.</p>

                <h3>6A.5 Withdrawal of Consent</h3>
                <p>You may withdraw your benchmarking consent at any time via <strong>Settings &gt; Data &amp; Privacy &gt; Benchmarking</strong>. Once withdrawn, no further data from your account will be contributed to the benchmarking pool. However, data that has already been anonymised and contributed cannot be retrospectively removed, as it is no longer identifiable.</p>

                <h3>6A.6 No Obligation</h3>
                <p>You are not required to participate in the benchmarking database to use Rates Goblin. Opting out will not affect your access to any features or the quality of service you receive.</p>
